# Zybo Sampler
![Zybo](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/programmable-logic/zybo/zybo-0.png)

----
This is an **Audio Sampler** and (maybe) a **Syntheziser** project created for the **Digilent Zybo** board. The idea is to recreate the audio engine of the Keyboard Workstations of the mid-late 2000's (like the **Fantom X series** from **Roland**) to create an open source **Hardware** sampler powerful enough to recreate any sound from the last decade... Let's see if this FPGA can do it.

I am basing this design on the architectures used in Roland and Korg keyboard, where the CPU is used to handle basic tasks like managing the display, lights, buttons, etc. and a dedicated sound engine is used to load the samples and perform DSP. From the processor speed and memory perspective, this board and FPGA should outperform the hardware present in those keyboards. However it is difficult to tell if the same will be true for the DSP and DMA capabilities present in those keyboards ASICs. Note that the idea is to end up with a user-friendly UI with a display and buttons and knobs and whatnot.

**Note** that this Zybo board has been discontinued and replaced by the Zybo Z7-10 and the Z7-20. The upgrades include more ram, faster clocks, a MIPI connector, a second HDMI port and (in the case of the Z7-20) a larger FPGA. This project will continue targeting the old Zybo because I'm not a Rockefeller.

# Setup instructions
## Tools Required
 - Xilinx Vivado 2020.1
 - Xilinx Vitis 2020.1

Before you build, you need to setup the environment. To do that, you need to run the Vivado and Vitis (previously Xilinx SDK) setup scripts like this
```bash
## From the Windows CMD shell
# Vivado
[CMD]>> call D:\Xilinx\Vivado\2020.1\settings64.bat
# Xilinx Vitis (previously Xilinx SDK)
[CMD]>> call D:\Xilinx\Vitis\2020.1\settings64.bat
## From the Linux Bash shell (TODO)
...
```

# Build stages
The build process goes through the following stages

### 1) Pack
This stage will package the individual cores using the Vivado IP Packaging tool so that they can be easily integrated into the final build

### 2) Integration
This stage will import all the packaged cores and will perform all the connections necessary to build the final design

### 3) Xilinx IP Synthesis
This stage will individually synthesize all Xilinx IPs to save time on the final implementation. Note that this stage is only strictly necessary when you haven't created the Xilinx IPs from the TCL scripts. Xilinx IPs instantiated in the integration stage can also be synthesized in the implementation stage

### 4) Implementation
This stage will import the generated sources from the integration stage and will perform Synthesis and Place and Route

### 5) Firmware workspace generation
This stage will create a Vitis workspace and configure the BSP and the Project application. Note that you will still need to open the Vitis GUI to compile the firmware and program the board

## Optional stages

### Lint
This stage only performs a simple compile to check for syntax errors. To run this stage you need to have passed at least stage 3)

# Build instructions
To build the project, you need to run one script using Vivado: `run.tcl`.

### Binary build
```bash
## Run the complete build flow from scratch
>> vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run.tcl -tclargs -cfg cfg/zybo_sampler.cfg

## Run only specific stages
# Stages: PACK | INTEG | GEN_XILINX_IP | IMPL | BUILD_WS | LINT (optional)
>> vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run.tcl -tclargs -cfg cfg/zybo_sampler.cfg -stages "<STAGE1>+<STAGE2>+..."
# Example
>> vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run.tcl -tclargs -cfg cfg/zybo_sampler.cfg -stages "INTEG+IMPL"

## Run with stage arguments
>> vivado -mode batch -source scripts/run.tcl -tclargs -cfg cfg/zybo_sampler.cfg -stages "<STAGE1>+<STAGE2>+..." --stage_args "<STAGE1>_ARG1=1" "<STAGE2>_ARG2=MyValue" --
```

### Firmware build
```bash
# Note 1: This stage can also be executed from Vivado, but it will be calling this command
# Note 2: This stage will only build the Vitis Workspace. 
#         You will need to load Vitis to compile the firmware and program the board
# Note 3: For Vitis 2019.2, there's a Windows bug related to the Xilinx Software Command Tool (xsct) 
#         You may need to apply this patch: https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/73252.html
>> xsct scripts/run.tcl -tclargs -cfg cfg/zybo_sampler.cfg -stages "BUILD_WS"
```


# Runtime instructions
Right now the project has very (**VERY**) limited functionality, but here's what you can do

## Launch the project
To launch the project, simply power on the Zybo and go into Vitis (previously Xilinx SDK) with the compiled project. Once you're there go to `Xilinx -> Program FPGA`. Select the bitfile from the `results/audio_sampler_integ` directory and click on `Program`

Now that the bitfile has been downloaded, go to your Project Explorer and right click on the .elf file that is under `codec_fw -> Binaries -> codec_fw.elf`. On the menu, go to `Run As` and select `Run on Hardware (System Debugger)`.

## Interact with the CLI
To interact with the CLI, open a serial terminal (using a program like PuTTY) and configure the following settings

- `Baud Rate: 115200`
- `Data Bits: 8`
- `Stop Bits: 1`
- `Parity: None`

Once the settings have been configured, open the serial connection. You should be greeted with a screen like this one. You can type `help` to see the commands available.

## Example

### Hello Screen

### SD Card Initialization
Command
```>> sd_init```

### Show files in current directory
Command (after sd_init)
```>> dir```

# Instrument Definition
The sampler currently supports only one instrument at a time. Each instrument should be defined using a file in JSON format. The structure of such file is the following

## Instrument name
The instrument name should be located in the first layer of the JSON file (preferrably at the beginning) like this
```json
{
    "instrument_name": "My Piano Library",
    ...
}
```

## Sample definition
The samples related to this instrument should be defined in a second layer called "samples" like this
```json
{
    ...
    "samples": {
        ...
    }
}
```

Inside this section, the samples for each note should be defined as follows
```<NOTE_NAME><NOTE_NUMBER>(_S)```
where:
- ```<NOTE_NAME>``` Is the name of the note (A to G).
- ```<NOTE_NUMBER>``` Is note number (0 to 8).
- ```(_S)``` Is optional. It represents a "sharp" note

Example: "```A4_S```" is equivalent to A4#

Each has its own sub_fields, such as sample path (relative to the .json file) and minimum and maximum velocities (Note. Right now only 1 velocity range is supported, but this will be expanded for multi-sampled instruments). The field names are:

- ```sample_file``` This points to the sample file relative to the .json file
- ```velocity_min``` Minimum velocity
- ```velocity_max``` Maximum velocity

Example:

```json
{
    ...
    "samples": {
        ...
        "C3_S": {
            "sample_file": "samples/piano_c3_sharp.wav",
            "velocity_min": 0,
            "velocity_max": 255,
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
